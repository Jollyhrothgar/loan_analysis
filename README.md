# How to Pay Off Student Loans

The goal of this repo is to provide tools to folks to understand how their
student loan repayment plan will proceed. A few different scenarios are
provided in the jupyter notebook representing different payment strategies.

The overall goal of this repo is to provide users with a payment strategy which
they can follow with minmal effort that minimizes the amount of interest they
pay to student loan lenders.

For most people, they have a fixed amount of money which they can put towards
paying off various debts every month. The goal in paying any debt is generally
to minimize the total amount of money you pay back to the debt collector. My
thinking in general is that this process is non-intuitive, since its hard to
deal with multiple different loans with different interest rates and balances. 

While the single biggest factor in reducing the payoff time and paid interest
is obviously the size of your monthly payment, there are secondary factors
which might affect how you allocate payments. This is because generally, the
ONLY parameter people can control with regards to student loans is how much
they pay - nothing else.

This tool opts to additionally provide some means to answer common questions
like:

- If I have N loans with X interest rates, how much do I have to pay if I want
  to pay off these loans in N years?
- How should I allocate my monthly payment to minimize the total amount I
  repay?
- Will I save more money if I pay down one large loan while allowing smaller
  loans to accumulate interest?

I hope to address all these questions and more.

# TODO

- Add different kinds of debt, such as credit-card payments and car payments
- Make more user-friendly. Goal is basically a website that a non-expert can
  use, potentially via exposed jupyter notebook widgets.
